The Roman Baths are thermal springs in Bath. The Romans created baths and a temple in the River Anon valley. There are four parts: the Sacred Spring, the Roman Temple, the Roman Bath House, and a museum.

A century later, the Roman baths were in ruins. During the Early and Late Middle Ages, the Roman Baths were restored.
